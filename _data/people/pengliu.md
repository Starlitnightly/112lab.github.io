Liu Peng hopes to use the knowledge of machine learning algorithms and automated control theory that I have learnt in my automation studies to develop algorithms with better performance according to specific life sciences problems and better tell the story of life sciences, and he hopes that his work can be practically put into practice (e.g., the integration of multimodal data to focus on the disease, the knowledge mapping of medical literature, etc.) to contribute his own humble efforts in realising the cause of precision medicine.
